##### Summer Internship

I had the exciting opportunity to complete a summer internship at [Traverse Research](https://traverse.nl/), where my main task was to develop a real-time Gaussian Splatting viewer - an exciting and emerging technology in computer vision, and integrate it into the existing codebase. I also wrote a blog post detailing the experience, which you can read [here](https://www.evolvebenchmark.com/blog-posts/3d-gaussian-splatting-rendering-gaussian-splats-in-real-time).

##### Team Size:
* Solo project

##### Time Bounds:
* 2 months

##### By the end of the project I gained knowledge in:		
* Tile rasterization in compute
* Deepened my knowledge of Rust/HLSL
* Deepened knowledge of modern rendering pipelines and APIs 
* Computer vision
