##### Software rasterizer made in Rust
This [project](https://github.com/KonstantinKz/rusterizer) was part of a masterclass held at our school and served as a great opportunity to learn Rust and deepen my understanding of rasterization algorithms. It was completed in less than a week, and the final result is capable of loading and rendering a textured 3D model in real time.


##### Team Size:
* Solo project

##### Time Bounds:
* 1 week

##### By the end of the project I gained knowledge in:		
* Math concepts related to the rasterization
* Learned basics of Rust
* Different triangle culling algorithms
* Deepened knowledge of modern rendering pipelines
