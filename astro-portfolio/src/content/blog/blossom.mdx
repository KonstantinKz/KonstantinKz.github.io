##### Game and Custom Engine

[Blossom](https://buas.itch.io/blossom-engine) is a relaxing game where you play as a bee, collecting pollen to return to your hive and help restore the environment.

This school project began as a custom engine with the focus on the graphics development. It was initially developed over two months in collaboration with four other programmers, and later expanded over an additional two months with a larger team of 11 people, including artists and designers. 

The custom engine is designed to procedurally generate natural 3D environments. It features tools for vegetation placement, stylized visual rendering, and a built-in noise editorâ€”allowing users to create entire environments from scratch, all within the engine.

##### Team Size:
* 6 programmers (4 specializing on graphics, 2 - engine and tools)
* 2 Designers
* 3 artists

##### Time Bounds:
* 4 months

##### My role:
* Graphics Programmer (focus on PlayStation 5)

##### My Contribution:
* Design and implementation of cross-platform rendering API
* Tessellation for terrain rendering on both platforms (PS5 and OpenGL)
* Implementation of cascaded shadow-mapping on (PS5 and OpenGL) 
* Procedural grass generation and instanced (chunk) rendering on PS5
* Blending between multiple terrain materials (PS5)
* Subsurface Scattering shader (PS5 and OpenGL)
